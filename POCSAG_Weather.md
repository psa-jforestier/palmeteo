# POCSAG Weather data decoding

! This is widely work in progress. Use github issue to comment !

Some weather station (Lacrosse Starmeteo) can receive weather forecast and time synchronization without being connected to internet. They do not use DCF77 or other low-frequency time sync. It seems they use the POCSA protocol on 466MHz.

## StarMeteo / MeteoFrance / WETTERdirekt protocols

The protocol for weather forecast has not been reversed for now. We can have some assumption by reading the Lacrosse documentation of such weather station (search for WD2900, WD6000 user manual ).

Documentation said, for the French version of a weather station :
```
- 1/ Average time to be time synchronized : 40 to 70 minutes
- 2/ Depending of the station area, the time can be +/- 2 minutes. Generally, time drifting is under a minute or a few seconds.
- 3/ Default forecast location is Paris (dept nÂ° 75). It can be change in the station (enter a number from 1 to 95). After initialization, forecast of the default location is displayed (even if you are far from this location).
- 4/ In maximum 6h, the forecast for the selected area will be displayed
```

**From 1/ and 2/** : we deduce the weather station do not use DCF77 (which can synchronize time in a minute). So time sync use the same type of receiver than the weather data. It should only have one frequency to receive all data (time + forecast).

**From 3/** : the forecast from the default region is send to all the POCSAG server station, even stations far from Paris. It can be done by different ways : 
- forecast for all regions is always send to all the POCSAG server network, meaning that someone in north of France will be able to receive forecast from south (800km appart) just by configuring the proper region on the weather station
- or forecast for Paris is always send everywhere (on the all POCSAG server network) but local weather forecast is also send locally only. You will not be able to have forecast from a far location, except Paris.

Second option is most efficient.

**From 4/** : by recording all POCSAG traffic in a 6h window, we should be able to view data related to forecast of Paris and of the local area.

## About POCSAG

POCSAG protocol is a regional UHF (466Mhz) protocol . A POCSAG transmitter send signal to maybe 50Km at max. So there is a mesh of POCSAG transmitter all over the country. They are connected to each other via Satellite link or internet.
This is a commercial service. A data provider (like Lacrosse) pay to the POCSAG provider some fees to spread its data messages, depending on the area it wants to cover.

Each POCSAG data frame is made of :
- a **address or Channel Access Protocol code (CAPCode)** which is a number identifying like a client or a receiver (every receiver sensible to address 1234 will be able to handle message sent to 1234).
- a message, which can be text or number.

## Receiver POCSAG data frame

With a rtl-sdr station 1 (SDR# + PDW as the POCSAG decdoer) and an OpenWebRX station 2, separated 200km from each other, I noticed the following thing :

- Because this stations are far from each other, weather forecast should be different
- But the time synchro must be the same

After listening for hours this two machine, I noticed some data frame that are good candidate to explore the Lacrosse / StarMeteo protocol :
- POCSAG channel is 466,205 MHz
- Address is 0025176 : this is the only adress sending cabalistics messages at regular interval

So I setup this two listening station to focus on 466.205MHz and receive only message sent to address 0025176.

Some data are in common between Station 1 and Station 2 and are received in less than 10s. Examples :
```
Station 1 - SDR#
12:21:09 11-08-23 1+!.:%p-& )''39ED-'0T!&49%8"F0("F69E8s&0,s&;
12:41:11 11-08-23 1+!.:%p-& )''39ED-'0T!&49%8"F0("F69E8s&0,s&;
Station 2 - OpenWebRX
12:21:14 11-08-23 1+!.:%p-& )''39ED-'0T!&49%8"F0("F69E8s&0,s&;
12:41:13 11-08-23 1+!.:%p-& )''39ED-'0T!&49%8"F0("F69E8s.6,s&;
```
20 mn from each other, but they are exactly the same. It could not be a time synchronization.

Some frames are differents, send in burst, but look similar :
```
Station 1 - SDR#
12:31:09 11-08-23 ZH<2H:HBHRI"I*I:IZK)
12:31:24 11-08-23 ZH<2H:HBHRI"I*I:IZK)
12:31:37 11-08-23 ZH<2H:HBHRI"I*I:IZK)
12:31:52 11-08-23 ZH<2H:HBHRI"I*I:IZK)
Station 2 - OpenWebRX
12:31:13 11-08-23 kK<:HJHZI"I*I2I:IJJ"J*JBHI
12:31:27 11-08-23 kK<:HJHZI"I*I2I:IJJ"J*JBHI
12:31:41 11-08-23 kK<:HJHZI"I*I2I:IJJ"J*JBHI
12:31:54 11-08-23 kK<:HJHZI"I*I2I:IJJ"J*JBHI
```

I'm still looking for some data frame that may match my assumptions : is should have a region identifier (different from Station1 to Station2), data in common (for time sync), different data for weather forecast.

The time sync frame should be sent with small variation, but I dont know how many times per hour they are sent.
