# Some info about RTL_433

This is a great open source program running on Windows and Linux, including the Raspberry Pi. Check-it out from https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433 and star it !

Here are some usefull command to use this program.

## Basic commands
- `rtl_433 -f 868.3M -T 30` : Tune on a frequency (868.3 MHz) and run from a limited amount of time (30 seconds) with default decoders enabled.
- `rtl_433 -f 868.3M -f 433M -H 1 -T 30` : move from two freq with 1s delay and run from a limited amount of time (30 seconds). Ideal to monitor two frequency at almost the same time.
- `rtl_433 -R` : list all decoders. the ones with a * are unstable and not enabled by default.
- `rtl_433 -G 4` : enable all decoders, even the unstable one. This flag seems to have changed on last version.
- `rtl_433 -R 75 -R 76` : enable only the decoder nÂ°75 and 76
- `rtl_433 -R -75 -R -76` : enable all decoders except 75 and 76
- `rtl_433 -F csv` : output data in stdout in CSV format. Other format are available with "-F ?" (json, mqtt...)
- `rtl_433 -F http` : run an http interface. Go to http://localhost:8433 and a web interface dispay data received (seems to be experimental)

## Discovering a new protocol

So you have a new sensor and you want to decode it with rtl_433 ? You have to :
- search for the frequency (assuming it is 868.3MHz)
- set the sensor as close as possible to the RTL-SDR dongle
- remove the antena of the dongle. It is just to be sure that you receive only radio wave of this device.
- use rtl_433 in Analysis mode `rtl_433 -f 868.3M -A`
To be completed, but it is good to start with https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/blob/master/docs/ANALYZE.md
